Asset Bundles in Data Engineering – Beginner’s Guide
Welcome to the Asset Bundles in Data Engineering repository! This project is designed for beginners who want to understand how to structure, organize, and process datasets in a systematic way, following best practices in data engineering.

📌 Overview
In modern data engineering, datasets are often organized into Asset Bundles, which are collections of related data assets. This approach helps to:

Maintain a clear source of truth for raw, processed, and curated data.
Facilitate incremental data processing.
Enable efficient data pipelines with tools like Apache Spark, Airflow, and cloud storage solutions.
This repository provides examples and exercises to help you understand how to structure and manage these asset bundles in practice.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python & PySpark
Apache Spark
Apache Airflow (for scheduling)
Delta Lake / Parquet for storage
Git & GitHub for version control
Local or cloud-based file storage (S3, Azure Data Lake, etc.)
